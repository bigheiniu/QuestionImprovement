## Dataset Introduction
This dataset expands the Jie Yang's [work](https://chauff.github.io/documents/publications/HYPER2014-yang.pdf) by adding the answer count for each revision. 

The data is in [__target.csv__](). The columns in __target.csv__ are as follows:

| Column Name  | Meaning                                                     |
| :----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| version      | The version of the question. It starts from 1.              |
| Text         | The text of current version of question.                    |
| change type  | The revision type of the question.                          |
| answer_count | The number of answers the question recieved after revision. |
| answer_label | The label of the answer count.                              |

It should be noticed that numeric change type has following map relationship:

| Value | Meaning                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| -1    | Spell Problem                       |

| 1     | Add Example/URL                     |
| 2     | Code Intervention                   |

| 6     | Solution                            |

- Otherwise, the answer label is 1.
